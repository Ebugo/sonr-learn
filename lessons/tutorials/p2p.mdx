# Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Networks

In this article we will talk about what P2P networks are and why they exist.

As far back as 1999, the P2P file sharing system was made popular when Shawn Fanning - while still a college student - created a music sharing system called Napster. Users could download copies of files from other users connected on the same network, and as such there was no need to depend on any centralised host.
This quickly gave rise to multiple P2P networks and file sharing services which we see today.

### What is a P2P Network??

A Peer-to-Peer network is a distributed system or architecture where tasks are shared across many computers. A single computer in the network, also known as a “peer” or “node”, has equal permissions with each other and shares the same responsibility or power. As such there is no central power that controls every other peer.

This decentralised nature of P2P networks makes them very difficult to be tampered with as they are less vulnerable to systemic failure. Also, each computer acts as both a server and a client unlike the traditional networks where there is a central server/host which every other user depends on. 

There are many benefits of using a peer-to-peer network which include the following:
- It is highly secure and very difficult to bring down. Peers continue to function and perform their functions even if a group of peers/nodes go down.
- Adding new peers to the network is easy because no central server configuration is needed. As a result, p2p networks are highly scalable.
- Processing and transferring of files via P2P networks are really fast and can take place simultaneously without any issue.

These benefits and more make p2p networks very important to the blockchain and cryptocurrency space.

I hope this helps someone!!!
