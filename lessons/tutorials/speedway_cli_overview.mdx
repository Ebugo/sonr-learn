## Introduction

In this dissertation, we will be going over Speedway Command-Line Interface (CLI). Speedway is a developer tool used to create applications on the Sonr Network. First, we'll dive into the installation of Speedway binary and how to create an account on the Sonr network using Speedway CLI. Then we will go over the modules of Sonr (<a href="https://www.sonr.dev/docs/reference/intro/registry" target="_blank">Registry</a>, <a href="https://www.sonr.dev/docs/intro/modules/schemas" target="_blank">Schemas</a>, <a href="https://www.sonr.dev/docs/intro/modules/objects" target="_blank">Objects</a>, & <a href="https://www.sonr.dev/docs/intro/modules/buckets" target="_blank">Buckets</a>) and how to build applications with them. We will also be building the initial components of a simple application using Speedway CLI.

## Installation of Binary



### Operating System

Speedway CLI is supported for the following operating systems:

- GNU/Linux
- macOS

### How to run Speedway CLI

After installing Speedway CLI, you can run it by typing `speedway -h` in your terminal.

## Account

### Creating an Account

Creating an account on the Sonr Network is very simple. To create an account utilizing the Speedway CLI, simply run the following command:

```bash
    speedway account create
```

You will be prompted to enter a password. Please enter your desired password and proceed with the registration.

Please note that creating an account can take some time, do not quit the process.

After the account has been created, you will be given your wallet address. e.g. snr17j0p89ugmd96dd95uzaygkd8w9ey8lu3ayuey7 This wallet address is utilized to login, receive funds and is used for some transactions on the ecosystem. The DSC and PSK are also saved into your Keychain automatically.

### Logging in

Logging into your account on the Speedway CLI is very simple. As of now, if you need to execute a command, the CLI will auto-login to the account when needed.

## Alias

### Purchase an Alias

Purchase an Alias with the following command:

```bash
    speedway account buy-alias
```

If the alias flag is not passed, you will be prompted to enter your desired alias.

With the alias flag, you can pass the alias you want to purchase:

```bash
    speedway account buy-alias --alias <alias>
```

Please note that the purchase of an Alias costs 10 SNR

## Schemas

Schemas are used to store the records of verifiable objects for a specific application. Schemas are used to create a developer's custom application protocols which can be asserted in order to verify your application data. Schemas are ubiquitous by nature, meaning you're not limited to using the Schemas you created.

### Creating a Schema

To create a schema, run the following command:

```bash
    speedway schema create
```

The Speedway CLI will attempt to auto-login to your account utilizing the address and keys stored in your Keychain. If the process fails, you will be prompted to enter your address and keys manually.

Once logged in, you will be prompted for the label of the Schema. The label is simply the title of the Schema. e.g., "Team Schema"

Secondly, you will be prompted to enter the label & fields of the schema. The field types consist of string, integers, booleans, and floats. The label and field type should be entered as the following `label:type` for multiple fields simply separate them with a comma (no spaces) e.g.

```bash
    name:string,age:int,isAdult:bool,personality:float
```

Creating a Schema with flags: Speedway CLI also offers the ability to create a schema with a pre-written JSON file.

```bash
    speedway schema create --file <PATH_TO_FILE>
```

Example of a Schema file in JSON:

![schema_example.png](/assets/lessons/speedway_cli_overview/schema_example.png)

When creating a schema with a JSON file, the fields are instead entered as an integer. The integer represents the type of field. The types are as follows:

```bash
    LIST = 0
    BOOL = 1
    INT = 2
    FLOAT = 3
    STRING = 4
    BYTES = 5
    LINK = 6
```

Note that if the file cannot be read, you will be prompted to create the Schema as explained previously.

### Querying a Schema

To Get a Schema, run the following command:

```bash
    speedway schema get [DID]
```

If the DID has not been passed with the command, you will be prompted to provide the Schema DID.

## Objects

Objects are data persisted within an off-chain storage network and given a content identifier (CID), which represents the Object in the network. When uploading an object for storage, there must be validation against a schema in order to match in both property, name, and type.

### Building an Object

To build an Object, run the following command:

```bash
    speedway object build
```

Once logged in, you will be prompted to enter the Schema DID that will be associated with this new Object. After the Schema has been resolved and printed out, you are required to enter the associated Object & value for that Object.

Upon the Object being built, the CLI will return an Object Reference that contains a CID (Content ID), DID (Digital Identifier) & a Label (Label for the Object).

Example of Resolved Schema (using our previous "Team Schema" example):

```bash
    Resolved Schema: {
    "creator": "snr16u3ukzrlx96la25j7w52h2ev87282vhquuy3yk",
    "label": "Team Schema",
    "fields": [
            {
            "name": "name",
            "field": 4
            },
            {
            "name": "age",
            "field": 2
            },
            {
            "name": "isAdult",
            "field": 1
            },
            {
            "name": "personality",
            "field": 3
            }
        ]
    }
```

Building an Object with the did and label flags:

```bash
    speedway object build --did <DID_of_associated_schema> --label <Name_of_Object>
```

Building an Object with the file flag:

```bash
    speedway object build --file <PATH_TO_FILE>
```

Example of an Object file in JSON: 
![object_example.png](/assets/lessons/speedway_cli_overview/object_example.png)

### Querying an Object

To Query an Object, run the following command:

```bash
    speedway object query
```

If the CID has not been passed with the command via a flag, you will be prompted to provide the Object CID.

## Buckets

Similar to Amazon S3 or DigitalOcean Spaces, developers can leverage our decentralized storage module for uploading either application-specific assets or user-specific assets. The Sonr bucket module is used to record the defined collections of Objects utilized by an Application on the Sonr Network. A bucket can be either public access, private access, or restricted access based on Developer configuration.

### Creating a Bucket

To create a Bucket, run the following command:

```bash
    speedway bucket create
```

Upon being automatically logged in, you will be prompted to enter the label of the Bucket. The label is simply the title of the Bucket. e.g., "Team Bucket" Afterward, you will be prompted to enter the owner address of the Bucket. The owner address is the address of the developer who owns the Bucket. e.g. "snr16u3ukzrlx96la25j7w52h2ev87282vhquuy3yk". Lastly, you will be prompted to enter the visibility type of the Bucket. The role type is the type of access the Bucket has. e.g. "public" or "private" & "user" or "application".

### Querying a Bucket

To Query a Bucket, run the following command:

```bash
    speedway bucket get
```

If the DID has not been passed with the command, you will be prompted to provide the Bucket DID.

## Conclusion

After reading this guide, you should have a good understanding of how to use the Speedway CLI and will have created the initial components of an application on the Sonr Network. All that is needed now is to create a web or mobile application that utilizes the Schema, Objects, and Buckets you have created.
